Welcome to the codebase of the **CRISPRzip tool** from the [Depken Lab](https://depkenlab.tudelft.nl/) at TU
Delft.

## About the project
### The CRISPRzip model
CRISPRzip is a physics-based model to study the target 
recognition dynamics of CRISPR-associated nucleases like Cas9
([Eslami-Mossalam, 2022](#references)). Their interactions with target DNA is represented 
as an energy landscape, with which you can simulate binding and cleavage
kinetics. The parameters have been obtained by machine learning on 
high-throughput data. CRISPRzip makes quantitative predictions of on-target 
efficiency and off-target risks of different guide RNAs. With CRISPRzip, we hope 
to contribute to assessing
the risks that come with particular choices in CRISPR application, and as such
contribute to the development of safe gene editing technology.

### The tool
With the CRISPRzip tool/GUI, you can apply CRISRPzip to the sequences of your 
interest without having to do any programming. It's a matter of installing the
right executable for your computer (Windows/Mac/Linux) and launching it.

The CRISPRzip tool is powered by [NiceGUI](https://nicegui.io/) and 
[PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/).

### The Python package
If you are familiar with Python and would like to work with the source code:
good news! It's available as a public [GitHub project](https://github.com/hiddeoff/crisprzip)
and as Python package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/crisprzip/).

Download and follow the user instructions below.

#### Available platforms
| Platform and file |
|---------------|
| [CRISPRzip tool for Windows](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/6RryClcq5BG8hMV) |
| [CRISPRzip tool for macOS](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/hzAWS3RFbuZsKv7) |

### User instructions

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

1. Download the Windows file an unzip it. You should see a file named `CRISPRzip.exe`.
2. Double-click on the `CRISPRzip.exe` file.
3. You might see a warning saying "Windows protected your PC". If so, click on "More info" indicated by the arrow in the image below:

<img src="img/win_screenshots/CRISPRzip_win_screenshot0.png" alt="win instructions image 0" width="500"/>

This message is expected. Windows displays this warning for applications that are not distributed through the Microsoft Store or are not signed with a recognized code signing certificate. Obtaining such a certificate typically requires an annual fee paid to a certificate authority. This does not indicate a problem with the application itself, but is a standard part of Microsoft’s security measures for software from outside the Microsoft Store or unsigned applications.

4. To proceed, click on "Run anyway" indicated by the arrow in the image below:

<img src="img/win_screenshots/CRISPRzip_win_screenshot1.png" alt="win instructions image 1" width="500"/>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>macOS</summary>

1. Download the macOS file an unzip it. You should see a file named `CRISPRzip.app`.

*Note: The file extension may not be visible if your system is set to hide extensions.*

2. Double-click on the `CRISPRzip.app` file. You will see a message like this:

<img src="img/macos_screenshots/1.png" alt="macOS instructions image 1" width="300"/>

This message is expected. Apple displays this warning for applications that are not distributed through the Mac App Store or not notarized by their developer program. Notarization requires an annual developer fee of 99 EUR. Rest assured, this does not indicate a problem with the application itself, but is a standard part of Apple’s security measures for software from outside the App Store.

3. To proceed, open your "System Settings", go to "Privacy & Security", scroll down, and you will see this message:

<img src="img/macos_screenshots/2.png" alt="macOS instructions image 2" width="700"/>

click on "Open Anyway".

4. You will be then prompted with this window when opening the CRISPRzip tool:

<img src="img/macos_screenshots/3.png" alt="macOS instructions image 3" width="200"/>

click on "Open Anyway".

5. Enter your password.

<img src="img/macos_screenshots/4.png" alt="macOS instructions image 4" width="200"/>

6. CRISPRzip tool will now run as a standard app, and you will not need to repeat these steps for future launches.

<img src="img/macos_screenshots/6.png" alt="macOS instructions image 6" width="700"/>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Linux</summary>

1. Download the Linux file an unzip it. You should see a file named `CRISPRzip`.
2. Double-click on the `CRISPRzip` file.
3. You might see a warning that it is not from a trusted publisher. Allow it to run.

### Browser NiceGUI application
As an alternative to the downloadable applications, you could clone this
repository and launch CRISPRzip tool from the terminal. It will open in your
browser. This way to launch the tool is sometimes (a lot) faster than the 
executables. Follow the developer instructions below.

## Developers
To use and develop the GUI, run the following commands:
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiddeoff/crisprzip-tool.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository.
3. Create a virtual environment (venv or conda), activate it, and install the required dependencies.
```bash
conda create -n crisprzip_gui python=3.12
conda activate crisprzip_gui
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.  Run the GUI. It should launch in your browser.
```bash
python crisprzip_gui.py
```

## Building the executable
If you want to build the executable for the CRISPRzip tool, you can build it with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). From the root of the project directory, run the following command for your platform:

<details>
  <summary>Windows</summary>

```bash
pyinstaller crisprzip_gui.py ^
    --name CRISPRzip ^
    --onefile ^
    --windowed ^
    --add-data "%VENV_PATH%\Lib\site-packages\nicegui\static;nicegui/static" ^
    --add-data "%VENV_PATH%\Lib\site-packages\latex2mathml\;latex2mathml" ^
    --collect-all nicegui ^
    --collect-all crisprzip ^
    --collect-all matplotlib ^
    --collect-all numpy ^
    --collect-all pandas ^
    --hidden-import uvicorn.logging
```
- Important: Set `%VENV_PATH%` with the appropriate path to your system!
</details>

<details>

```bash
pyinstaller crisprzip_gui.py \
  --name CRISPRzip \

  --onefile \
  --add-data "$lib_path/site-packages/nicegui:nicegui/static" \
  --add-data "$lib_path/site-packages/latex2mathml:latex2mathml" \

  --exclude-module gi --exclude-module PyGObject --exclude-module gtk
```
- Important: Set the `lib_path` variable with the correct path to your system!

</details>

These commands will create a `dist` folder containing the executable and a `build` folder with the build files. Alternatively, you can run these commands from the `bin` folder, which contains scripts to build the executable for your platform. Remember to update the paths as needed.
